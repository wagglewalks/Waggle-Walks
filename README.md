# Waggle-Walks
We are a local dog walking service that raises money for dog shelters and helps kids learn how to save money. 10% of our profits go to “I Dream of Home Rescue”. Here is their website: https://www.idohr.org/  We charge 10 dollars for 30 minutes, 15 dollars for 45 minutes and 20 dollars  for an hour. We provide home made dog biscuits for each customer that are guaranteed to satisfy.
